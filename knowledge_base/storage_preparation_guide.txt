- 12-24 hours for steaks and chops
- Safest method, maintains quality

Cold Water Thawing
- Submerge in cold water (70°F or below)
- Change water every 30 minutes
- 30 minutes per pound thawing time
- Keep meat in waterproof packaging
- Cook immediately after thawing

Microwave Thawing
- Use defrost setting based on weight
- Turn or rearrange every few minutes
- Cook immediately after thawing
- Some areas may begin cooking during process
- Not recommended for large cuts

Never Thaw At:
- Room temperature (bacteria growth risk)
- In warm water
- Outside or in garage
- In direct sunlight
- On heating vents or radiators

PREPARATION GUIDELINES
======================

Workspace Preparation
- Clean and sanitize all surfaces
- Use separate cutting boards for meat
- Wash hands for 20 seconds before and after handling
- Have sanitizing solution available
- Keep paper towels within reach

Equipment Needs
- Sharp knives (dull knives are dangerous)
- Separate cutting boards (color-coded recommended)
- Meat thermometer (instant-read preferred)
- Tongs and meat forks
- Sanitizing solution (1 tablespoon bleach per gallon water)

Cross-Contamination Prevention
- Wash hands between handling different products
- Use separate utensils for each type of meat
- Clean cutting boards thoroughly between uses
- Sanitize surfaces after each use
- Wash kitchen towels in hot water after use

COOKING TEMPERATURES
====================

Internal Temperature Guidelines
- Ground exotic meats: 160°F (71°C)
- Whole muscle steaks: 145°F (63°C) + 3-minute rest
- Game birds/poultry: 165°F (74°C)
- Wild boar: 160°F (71°C) - cook thoroughly
- Venison/elk: 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare

Thermometer Usage
- Insert into thickest part of meat
- Avoid bone, fat, or gristle
- Clean thermometer between uses
- Calibrate thermometer monthly
- Digital instant-read thermometers most accurate

Rest Periods
- Allow meat to rest 3-5 minutes after cooking
- Internal temperature will rise 5-10°F during rest
- Cover loosely with foil during rest
- Larger roasts need 10-15 minutes rest
- Resting redistributes juices for better flavor

SPECIAL HANDLING TIPS
=====================

Game Meat Characteristics
- Leaner than conventional meats
- Can become tough if overcooked
- Benefits from marinades and slow cooking
- Strong flavors may need balancing
- Different cuts require different cooking methods

Exotic Poultry
- Quail and small birds cook very quickly
- Duck requires fat rendering
- Ostrich cooks like beef (serve medium-rare)
- Pheasant benefits from brining
- Wild turkey dries out easily

Specialty Meats
- Kangaroo: High protein, very lean, cook rare
- Alligator: Mild flavor, don't overcook
- Rabbit: Similar to chicken, can be dry
- Yak: Rich flavor, cook like premium beef
- Bison: Leaner than beef, reduce cooking time by 25%

MARINATING GUIDELINES
=====================

Marinating Times
- Thin cuts (steaks): 2-4 hours
- Thick cuts (roasts): 4-24 hours
- Ground meat: 30 minutes to 2 hours
- Poultry: 2-12 hours
- Never marinate more than 24 hours

Marinade Safety
- Always marinate in refrigerator
- Use glass, ceramic, or food-grade plastic containers
- Turn meat every few hours
- Discard marinade after use (unless boiled first)
- Reserve some marinade before adding raw meat for basting

Acidic Marinades
- Contain vinegar, wine, or citrus
- Break down tough fibers
- Don't over-marinate (can make meat mushy)
- Good for game meats
- Add oil to prevent moisture loss

FOOD SAFETY REMINDERS
=====================

Danger Zone
- Bacteria multiply rapidly between 40-140°F
- Don't leave meat at room temperature over 2 hours
- 1 hour limit when temperature exceeds 90°F
- Refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours
- When in doubt, throw it out

Signs of Spoilage
- Off or sour odors
- Slimy or sticky texture
- Gray or green discoloration
- Excessive liquid in package
- Package bloating or gas

Emergency Procedures
- If power outage exceeds 4 hours, check meat temperature
- Dry ice can extend storage time in emergencies
- Generator backup for large freezers recommended
- Know location of emergency food thermometer
- Have backup refrigeration plan

LEFTOVER MANAGEMENT
===================

Storage Guidelines
- Refrigerate cooked meat within 2 hours
- Use within 3-4 days
